Install the latest version of the local Ionic CLI installed by typing the command:

npm install -g ionic@latest

To start a new Ionic project, type the command:

ionic start myapp --type ionic1

Now go into the newly created myapp directory, and you will see directory called www inside.

Delete everything inside of the www folder, and the files of "WAIFAA_ionic" into the www folder. The directory structure should look like:


Next, move the directory called SCSS-MOVEME up one directory, and rename it to scss. This directory should now sit side-by-side with the www directory.

Now, run the command npm install from directly inside the myapp folder. This will install gulp.js and a few handy tasks, such as gulp-sass and gulp-minify-css.

Finally, in the ionic.config.json file, add the JavaScript property "gulpStartupTasks": ["sass", "watch"].
